31 weapons used by the Yautja, also known as Predators, across various Predator movies. The weapons range from traditional to technologically advanced, showcasing the Predators' formidable arsenal.

Here's a breakdown of some of the key weapons:

Wrist Blades : These are retractable, serrated blades attached to the Predator's gauntlet, often synonymous with the species. They are significant in Yautja culture, particularly for honor, and have non-combat applications like unlocking mechanisms.

Shurikens : Similar to smart discs, these throwing weapons have built-in tracking and flight correction capabilities, allowing them to pursue multiple targets and return to the user.

Combi Stick : A special weapon given to Predators upon completing training, known for its speed, balance, and strength in hand-to-hand combat. It can also be thrown with accuracy.

Smart Disc : Equipped with advanced gyros, this disc returns to its wielder and has auto-guidance, able to track multiple targets using body heat signatures.

Plasma Caster : A shoulder-mounted weapon that fires armor-penetrating plasma bolts, adjustable in power from minor shots to blasts capable of breaching interstellar vessels.

Self-Destruct Device : Concealed within the wrist gauntlet, this device allows Yautja to self-destruct in dire situations, with adjustable devastation levels to align with their code of honor.

Whip (Razor Whip) : An agile and flexible segmented bull whip capable of cutting adversaries in half and resistant to xenomorph acidic blood.

Netgun : A compact handheld device that propels a rapidly expanding net, capable of tightening and cutting into the flesh of anything caught.

Speargun : A projectile weapon that propels metal spears with high velocity and precision, capable of impaling victims onto solid surfaces.

Cut Clamp : A cutting and throwing weapon that looks like a segmented blade with a claw-like hook, tearing through objects when thrown.

Laser Guided Arrows : Introduced by the Feral Predator in Prey, these arrows are launched from a specialized firearm and guided by a laser targeting system for unparalleled accuracy.

Biomask (Bio-helmet) : More than just a mask, it provides zoom capabilities, vocal mimicry, breathing apparatus, diagnostics, and visual/audio recording systems, connecting directly with the wrist gauntlet.

Cloak (Invisibility System) : An essential tool that grants virtual invisibility by manipulating light around the Yautja's body, though it has limitations when in motion or against xenomorphs.

Falcon : A remote-controlled drone developed by the Super Predator Clan for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering, equipped with various vision modes.

Wrist Cannon : Integrated into the gauntlet, this weapon unleashes powerful energy bolts with significant firepower, though it lacks tracking features.

Predator Mines : Diverse mind-based weapons that are stationary until triggered by proximity or remote activation, with variants like laser mines, remote mines, and EMP mines.

Feral Predator's Wrist Shield : A compact, deployable, and durable shield used by the Feral Predator, capable of withstanding various attacks and also used offensively to slice through victims.

Disintegrator Gas : Used to decompose organic matter, specifically victim's heads, while leaving skulls intact, providing insight into how Predators make their trophies.

Laser Discs : Deployable discs that emerge from the gauntlet, unleashing powerful lasers capable of slicing through virtually any obstacle.

Predator Harpoon : A new addition to the upgrade Predator's arsenal, resembling a whip but firing as a harpoon from the gauntlet.

Scimitar Blades : Metallic bladed weapons similar to wrist blades but larger, offering increased range at the cost of maneuverability.

Dissolving Liquid : A potent corrosive blue liquid capable of dissolving organic matter, primarily used to eradicate evidence of xenomorph presence but also as a volatile weapon.

Scout Ship : Tethered to Motherships, these vessels serve as a vanguard for hunting journeys, equipped with thrusters, a sharp blade, and medium-range plasma cannons.

Mothership : Colossal mobile bases that serve as the base of operation for large Predator clans, featuring advanced cloaking technology and housing a xenomorph Queen for a ready supply of facehuggers.

Sword : A traditional human weapon that Yautjas may have adopted after encountering it during their hunts on Earth
